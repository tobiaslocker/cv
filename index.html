    <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
    <p>Software architect with experience across IoT, finance, and
    semiconductor domains.</p>
    <p>I value simplicity, clear reasoning, and tools that serve the
    problem, not the other way around. Linux is home base; well-designed
    systems are the goal. If you’re not using Vim motions, you’re just
    losing time.</p>
    <p>I learned the hard way — from bending copper to designing complex
    software systems. My strength is connecting details to design,
    translating complex requirements into reliable, scalable
    software.</p>
