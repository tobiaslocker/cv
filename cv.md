## About Me

Software architect with experience across IoT, finance, and semiconductor domains.

I value simplicity, clear reasoning, and tools that serve the problem, not the other way around.
Linux is home base; well-designed systems are the goal. If you’re not using Vim motions,
you’re just losing time.

I learned the hard way — from bending copper to designing complex software systems. My
strength is connecting details to design, translating complex requirements into reliable,
scalable software.

## Experience

### 2022–2024 — Senior Staff Engineer / Software Architect

*Infineon Technologies AG*, *Design In Tools for Automotive Body Power*, Munich, Germany

Led modernization of complex design-in tools, transforming legacy C++/Qt applications into
modular, maintainable systems. Collaborated with global teams to align designs on company level.
Drove the adoption of a unified build system, package management, and documentation across
multiple products, enabling reusable C++ components with Python bindings and providing
seamless integration for scripting and communication between both languages.
Established architecture documentation practices based on arc42 and C4 in a docs-as-code
CI-driven workflow, fostering efficient processes and software best practices.


### 2019–2022 — Software Architect / Software Developer / Quantitative Analyst

*PEH Wertpapier AG*, *Asset Management*, Frankfurt, Germany

Redesigned a technical scoring system into a scalable, containerized web application. Mentored
colleagues and established modern development practices. Implemented a clean separation
between backend computation and a responsive frontend, leveraging Python to orchestrate
numerical computations via a high-performance C library. Improved performance, scalability,
and usability for portfolio analysis. The application remains actively used and maintained.

### 2017–2019 — Software Engineer

*Device Insight GmbH*, *Product Development*, Munich, Germany

Contributed to the design and development of an edge computing platform enabling reliable
communication between distributed devices and cloud systems. Implemented core components
in C++/Qt and Go, focusing on modularity, portability, and efficient deployment across
embedded Linux environments. Automated build and cross-compilation workflows using Bash,
supporting streamlined delivery pipelines. The role combined hands-on engineering with
architectural responsibilities, spanning technologies from container orchestration to classic
Unix/Linux tooling.


### 2014–2017 — Engineering Consultant / Senior Engineering Consultant

*Alten Engineering GmbH*, Munich, Germany

Worked as a software engineer and consultant for automotive and semiconductor clients,
including BMW Group and Infineon Technologies. Gained hands-on experience in C++ and
Python/Qt development, contributing to embedded and desktop applications used in production
and testing environments. Navigated complex requirements and balanced implementation
pragmatism with software quality — lessons that strongly influenced later architectural
decisions.


### 2011–2013 — Working Student

*VDE Testing Facility*, Offenbach am Main, Germany

Assisted in EMC and acoustic testing, gaining early exposure to standardized test procedures,
measurement systems, and product certification processes.


### 2004–2008 — Electrician

*MS Elektrotechnik*, Friedrichsdorf, Germany

Worked in industrial and building installations, developing a solid technical foundation and
practical understanding of electrical systems.


### 2000–2004 — Vocational Training as Electrician

*Elektro Team Krause GmbH*, Bad Homburg, Germany
